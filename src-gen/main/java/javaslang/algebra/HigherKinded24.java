/**
 * <p>The <em>HigherKinded24</em> type declares a generic type constructor, which consists of
 * 24 inner/component types and one outer/container type.</p>
 * <p>HigherKinded24 is used to approximately simulate higher-kinded/higher-order types, which cannot be
 * expressed with Java.</p>
 * <p>Example: {@linkplain javaslang.Tuple24} implements HigherKind24 in order to override
 * {@link javaslang.algebra.Monad24#flatMap(javaslang.Function24)}.</p>
