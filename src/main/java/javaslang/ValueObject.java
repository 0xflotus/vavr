/**
 * Definition of the category of Value Objects, i.e. immutable, decomposable objects with an identity based on their
 * type and encapsulated values.
 * <p/>
 * This interface should be implemented by concrete classes only rather than extending it by other interfaces due to
 * its Serializable nature.
 * <p/>
 * By default a Value Object is not cloneable because of the following conclusion:
 * <blockquote>
 * "[...] , it doesnâ€™t make sense for immutable classes to support object copying, because copies would be virtually indistinguishable from the original."
 * </blockquote>
 * <em>(see Effective Java, 2nd ed., p. 61)</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Other methods than {@link #unapply()} do not define new API rather than specifying the behavior of standard Java API.
 * <p/>
 * In particular the identity of a Value Object should be defined by its content by implementing
 * {@linkplain Object#equals(Object)}, {@linkplain Object#hashCode()} and {@linkplain Object#toString()}
 * appropriately.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link #unapply()} method decomposes an Object by unwrapping it. This comes handy when using the
 * {@link javaslang.match.Match} API.
