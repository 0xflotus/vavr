## IDE

We use recent IDE version to develop Javaslang. IntelliJ IDEA is preferred over Eclipse.

Using IntelliJ IDEA, the Community Edition works out-of-the-box. The idea-settings.jar can be found in the repo.

The IDEA settings include:

* Code Style
* File templates
* Inspection profiles

## Coding Conventions

Just a few notes here. In general it is good to look at existing code to get a clear picture.

### Javadoc

* Public API needs javadoc, e.g. public classes and public methods.
* Non-trivial private methods need javadoc, too.
* A package, which is part of the public API, contains a `package-info.java`.
* Unit tests contain no javadoc at all (because they introduce no new API and contain no business logic).
* Running `mvn javadoc:javadoc` results in no javadoc errors.
* All classes start with the following copyright notice, which contains the list of core developers:
```java
/*     / \____  _    _  ____   ______  / \ ____  __    _______
 *    /  /    \/ \  / \/    \ /  /\__\/  //    \/  \  //  /\__\   JΛVΛSLΛNG
 *  _/  /  /\  \  \/  /  /\  \\__\\  \  //  /\  \ /\\/ \ /__\ \   Copyright 2014-2016 Javaslang, http://javaslang.io
 * /___/\_/  \_/\____/\_/  \_/\__\/__/\__\_/  \_//  \__/\_____/   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
 */
```

### Packages

* There is only one first-level package: javaslang.
* The maximum package depth is two.
* Package names are denoted in singular.
* Packages are sliced by domain (no util or tool packages).
* Package private classes are used in order to hide non-public API.
* Inner classes are preferred over package private classes in case of one-to-one dependencies.

### Unit tests

* Public API is tested.
* High-level functionality is tested in first place.
* Corner cases are tested.
* Trivial methods are not _directly_ tested, e.g. getters, setters.
* The test method name documents the test, i.e. 'shouldFooWhenBarGivenBaz'
* In most cases it makes sense to run one assertion per @Test.

### 3rd party libraries

* Javaslang has no dependencies other than Java.
* Unit tests depend solely on junit and assertj.
* Benchmarks are done with JMH

## SCM

* Commits are coarsely granular grouped by feature/change.
* Commits do not mix change sets of different domains/purpose.
* Commit messages provide enough detail to extract a changelog for a new release.
